# InsightOps

InsightOps is a comprehensive platform designed to provide in-depth tracking of operators, Active Verification Services (AVS), and their associated activities. As part of our platform, we developed a plugin named plugin-eigenavs, leveraging multiple tools and APIs, including the Dune API, to gather and present vital data on the blockchain ecosystem. 




We have utilized the **Dune API** for making this plugin named as plugin-eigenavs :
- Track **TVL (Total Value Locked)** data 
- Track **AVS metadata** by address, including details like:
  - AVS Name
  - Functionality
  - Logo
  - Twitter URL
  - Website URL
- Track **Operator TVL** and metadata by address, including:
  - Operator Name
  - Functionality
  - Logo
  - Twitter URL
  - Website URL
- Track the **relationship between Operators and AVS** by providing either an operator or AVS address.
